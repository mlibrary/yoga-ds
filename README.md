## Stack

Build a basic stack (first-in, last-out). It should have three operations:

 * push - push an item onto the stack
 * pop - take the last-inserted item off the stack and return it
 * size - return the number of elements currently in the stack

## Queue

Build a basic queue (first-in, first-out). It should have three operations:

 * enqueue - add an item to the "back" of the queue
 * dequeue - remove the "front" item (first-inserted) of the queue and return it
 * size - return the number of elements currently in the queue

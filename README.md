Data Structure Jam

## Stack

Build a basic stack (first-in, last-out). It should have three operations:

 * push - push an item onto the stack
 * pop - take the last-inserted item off the stack and return it
 * size - return the number of elements currently in the stack

## Queue

Build a basic queue (first-in, first-out). It should have three operations:

 * enqueue - add an item to the "back" of the queue
 * dequeue - remove the "front" item (first-inserted) of the queue and return it
 * size - return the number of elements currently in the queue

## Tree

Build a basic, sorted binary tree. The left side should be less than the right,
and the tree should only accept integer values.

Each node should have two operations:

 * left - return the left-side descendent; nil if none
 * right - return the right-side descendent; nil if none

The tree itself should have four operations:

 * root - return the root node
 * size - return the total node count
 * depth - return the depth of the tree
 * insert - add a node in the appropriate position
